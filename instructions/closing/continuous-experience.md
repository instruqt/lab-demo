# Continuous Experience

## What You Experienced

Throughout this lab, you've been working continuously without interruption:

- No exiting between chapters
- Terminal session persisted across pages
- Context never lost
- Smooth transitions

## Built-In Components

You've also seen integrated learning features:

- **Quizzes**: Testing understanding inline (like the dependency graph quiz)
- **Rich content**: Diagrams and formatted code examples
- **Interactive tasks**: Multi-step validation exercises with granular feedback

## For Your Labs

These capabilities are available to your learners:

- Higher engagement through continuous context
- Better completion rates (no friction from exits)
- Richer learning experiences with quizzes and interactive tasks

Platform capabilities integrated naturally into the learning flow, not as separate features that break momentum.
