# Welcome to Instruqt 2.0

This demonstration shows platform capabilities that make lab creation faster, more reliable, and scalable.

## What You'll Experience

As you explore, you'll experience solutions to common lab creation challenges:

**Declarative Dependencies** - Eliminate brittle bash polling scripts through implicit dependencies and built-in health checks. *70% maintenance reduction*

**Validation** - Catch configuration errors before deployment with static validation. *40% fewer support tickets*

**Version Control** - Manage all assets through git. Track who changed what, when, and why. Prevent unwanted changes.

**Team Collaboration** - Enable distributed teams to work simultaneously without overwriting changes. Multiple teams work in parallel without overwrites or conflicts.

**Module Reusability** - Share lab components and configurations across your organization. *80% duplication reduction*

## For Lab Creators

![Challenges](/assets/challenges.png)

If you're a lab creator, you'll recognize these familiar challenges: dependency management, asset sprawl, runtime-only errors, team coordination, and infrastructure duplication.

You'll see how Instruqt 2.0 addresses each of these problems.
